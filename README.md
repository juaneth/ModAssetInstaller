# ModAssetInstaller
A simple thing to install ModAssets for Beat Saber 

The application reads from the assetlist folder, if you want to add your own then either message me on discord at "j u a n#1331" with the type of asset (Banner, Pillow, Energy Bar or other), Name of asset (Could be anything) and image (Make sure it is attached and not linked to, makes it easier for me) or post it to the BSMG "Mod-Assets" channel and in about a week it will be added
